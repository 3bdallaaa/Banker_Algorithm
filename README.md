***Banker's Algorithm for Deadlocks Prevention in python with GUI***

Tkinter library is used for the GUI
The GUI is used for entering input values and displaying the output if it is safe or not and if it is safe it shows the sequence.

*Steps to enter the input values in the appropriate fields:
1.Number of processes
2.Number of resources
3.Initial allocation matrix (matrix)
4.Max requirement matrix (matrix)
5.Available resources (list)
6.Click the "Submit" button to execute the Banker's Algorithm.

The output will be displayed in the "Output" field:
If the system is in a safe state, the safe sequence of processes will be displayed.
If a deadlock is detected, an error message will be displayed.

7.Click the "Reset" button to clear the input and output fields and start over.

*Notes
The input values must be entered in the correct format for the program to work properly.
The program assumes that the input values are valid and does not perform any error checking.
